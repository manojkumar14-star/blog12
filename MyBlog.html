    <h1 align = "center"><mark>welcome to my blog</mark></h1>

    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p align = "justify">

Mahendra Singh Dhoni, popularly known as MS Dhoni, is one of the most admired cricketers in the world. Born on July 7, 1981, in Ranchi, Jharkhand, Dhoni rose from humble beginnings to become the captain of the Indian cricket team. His calm personality, exceptional leadership, and ability to perform under pressure earned him the nickname “Captain Cool.”
He is widely recognized as one of the greatest captains in cricket history, having led India to all three major ICC trophies — the T20 World Cup (2007), the ICC Cricket World Cup (2011), and the Champions Trophy (2013). Apart from his leadership, Dhoni is admired for his powerful batting style, especially his trademark helicopter shot, and his lightning-fast skills as a wicketkeeper.

Beyond international cricket, Dhoni is the heart and soul of the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the Indian Premier League (IPL), where he is lovingly called “Thala” by fans. His incredible achievements, humble personality, and inspirational journey have made him more than just a cricketer—he is a role model and an emotion for millions of fans across the globe.

    <h2>EarlyLife</h2>
    <p align = "justify">Dhoni’s story is nothing short of inspirational. Before stepping into cricket, he was passionate about football and badminton. In fact, he played as a goalkeeper in football during his school days. However, his talent in cricket was soon discovered, and he became a wicketkeeper-batsman.
</p>
<p align = "justify">Coming from a middle-class family, Dhoni also worked as a Ticket Collector (TC) for the Indian Railways before his cricketing career took off. His journey from a railway job to international stardom is a true example of determination and hard work.

<h2>Rise in International cricket </h2>
<p align = "justify">Dhoni made his ODI debut in 2004 against Bangladesh. Though he had a rough start, he quickly established himself with his fearless batting style. His explosive innings of 148 runs against Pakistan in 2005 and a massive 183 against Sri Lanka* made him one of the most dangerous batsmen in world cricket.
</p>
<p align = "justify">His calm approach and ability to guide the team under pressure soon caught the eye of the selectors, and he was given leadership responsibilities.
